<b>SkunkOS</b> is my personal FreeBSD "distro".<br>
Just that what I would like to use as my daily driver.<br>
<br>
It is not a "distro" in the usual sense, though. SkunkOS is pure FreeBSD.<br>
Just enhanced with configuration and management tools that I want but have to make myself because such does not exist yet. At least not in the way I would like it, powerful, but nonetheless easy and efficient to use.<br>
<br>
Obviously, the first component of SkunkOS is necessarily an installer.<br>
Like all SkunkOS components that will follow over time, it is sort of a "first".<br>
Because, "crazy" innovative things that do not yet exist have to be made first.<br>
Its plugin-based system management web interface with never-seen-before features will be the next component to follow.<br>
<br>
While this is in the works, the best way you can assist development is to use the Skunk Installer to install your laptop and desktop systems, and report with which hardware you had success.<br>
And if you had no success trying this, the best way to help is to open an issue, so we can together find out how to improve the Skunk Installer so that it can deal with hardware like yours.<br>
Thank you very much for your support!<br>
